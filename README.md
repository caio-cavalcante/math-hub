# Math Hub

## Description

This project, just as my personal portfolio, also started as a simple assessment in a Web Development class, and became a way to show my passion for math and skills as developer.

## Features

As of now, there are 4 functional buttons, with 1 being a work in progress.

- Factorial calculator gives you the factorial of a number. 
    - 5! = 120
- Fibonacci sequence generator returns the sequence until the nth number given.
    - Until the 6th Fibonacci: 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8.
- Prime number checker says if a number is prime, and if so, its position as a prime.
    - 37 is the 12th prime number.
- Square calculator shows the mathematical process of the square of a sum.
    - ![Example of 37 squared](https://github.com/caio-cavalcante/math-hub/public/blob/main/37squared.png)
- Triangle calculator will draw a triangle and show it lenghts and angles. (WIP)

## Instalation

While this website is not hosted and online, it is possible to download, or clone, the repo on GitHub. You need to open the project in an IDE (e.g., VS Code) and use the "Live Server" extension for a local preview of the index.html file.

## How to use

After starting the live server, just click in any of the buttons and input a desired number.
